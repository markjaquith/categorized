Unchecks the default post category when you first select a non-default category

## Description ##

1. Check a category.
2. Uncheck "Uncategorized".
3. Mutter "stupid 'Uncategorized'" under your breath.

Sound familiar? With this stupidly simple plugin, you just have to do the first step. When you check a category and the default category was the only thing checked before you clicked, it'll uncheck the default category for you. Boom.

## Installation ##

1. Upload the `categorized` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the "Categorized" plugin in your WordPress administration interface

Yeah, it should.

Probably not.
